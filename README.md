# Georgia-NCD-report

According to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) Global Burden of Disease data, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for 93% of all deaths in Georgia. Among them, 69% were because of cardiovascular diseases, 14% were because of cancer, 4% were because of chronic respiratory diseases, and 1% were because of diabetes. 

A nationally representative survey examining several NCDs and their risk factors was proposed to be included as part of the planned national Georgia Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Serosurvey in 2015. The objective of the NCD component of the survey was to estimate the prevalence of major NCDs and major risk factors of NCDs in adults aged 18 years and above in Georgia.
